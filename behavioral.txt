Interpersonal conflict story 1

* Conflict with Quinn when I started at Swoop.
* First major project was to refactor somewhat complex multi select component to add complexity based on product spec
* Looked at code. Difficult to read. Had things like a null meaning all boxes checked.
* Talked to Q about it. He said I could try refactoring. So I did it.
* Rewrote code and raised PR.
* Q wrote ‘Yuck, what is this’ on PR about my refactored
* I got angry about the comment because I thought it wasn’t professional and I thought my refactor was cleaner.
* I wanted to be transparent about the issue with Q. So I asked to have a private meeting with him and asked that we try to be respectful and professional in our PR reviews. That we can discuss tech disagreements but we should not use derogatory terms about each others work. He apologized and I could tell he was embarrassed. It never happened again.
* I also raised the issue to our manager after in private just to be transparent. He said I handled the situation well and to let him know if there were other issues.
* As for the technical disagreement, we discussed the code some more and eventually Q agreed that my explicit code was more readable. But I learned that what Q was trying to do was optimize more for performance, which made his code a bit less readable for the component. We worked together to try to find a balance between the 2 approaches and were successful in doing so.

HR mess up
*     Swoop
* I was working on a complicated new functionality on a hard deadline related to checking for insurance coverage for Lincoln
* At the same time, the CTO asked that we all hit 80% code coverage on all FE unit tests (for each PR)
* Agile process so lots of changes to code, meaning I’d have to re-write unit tests with every change to specs or BE changes to API
* Basically doubled my work load for each PR and I thought it was inefficient — worried about hitting my deadline
* Started being vocal in open office setting to teammates about how much I hated the new req. They also didn’t like it and some of them vocalized dislike too.
* My complaining was bringing down moral but I didn’t notice
* Our HR person pulled me aside to discuss the issue
* I felt embarrased
* Then Matt...
